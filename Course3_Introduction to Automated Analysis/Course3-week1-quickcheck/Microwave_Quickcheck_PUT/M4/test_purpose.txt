Mutation M4

The mutation in this example is a Boolean fault in DisplayController.java in 
the following code at line 14: 

   static final byte [] ROLLOVER = {5, 9, 5, 8};  // Fault here!  Should be 9 rather than 8 for "seconds" rollover
   
It should manifest itself in incorrect decrementing of time.
