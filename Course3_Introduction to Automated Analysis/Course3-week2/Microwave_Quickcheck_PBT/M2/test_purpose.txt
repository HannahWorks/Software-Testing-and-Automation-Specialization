Mutation M2

The mutation in this example is a off-by-one error in DisplayController.java in 
the following code: 

public synchronized void clearButtonPressed() {
      for (int i=0; i < 9; i++) {         // Fault here: should be < 10
         digitPressed[i] = false;
      }
      clearPressed = false;
   }
   
It should manifest itself in a "stuck" button press.
